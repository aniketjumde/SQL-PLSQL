What Is a Relationship in SQL?
A relationship in SQL defines how two or more tables are connected to each other using keys — mainly Primary Key and Foreign Key.


*** Types of relationship

	ex : Student ↔ Course
		A student can enroll in many courses,
		and a course can have many students.
2) One To Many / Many To One

3) One To one
